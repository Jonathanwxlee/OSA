                    "I want to major in Linguistics, and I knew that before I even took this class, but unfortunately this class is a pre-requisite to a lot of the required courses of the major. The class was large lecture hall, so attendance was not taken. Although the lectures supplemented the reading material, it was kind of easy to just learn from the book and read the powerpoints (that he would post online) later on. If I did not find this material interesting, this class would have been boring to me. If you only want to take this course as an easy D2 requirement, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",
                    "My only gripe was the weighting of assignments towards the final grade. Other than that, the course was fairly good.",
                    "good instructor, good lectures",
                    "I had pretty much learned everything taught in this class on my own, but I feel that this class would be an excellent introduction to linguistics. The course project, where you conduct field research on a specific topic, was especially enjoyable.",
                    "The course was for the most part very interesting, and the layout of the material made it extremely easy to manage even relatively long homework assignments. That said, there were a few longer assignments, and one in particular that seemed more tedious than important as we transcribed natural speech. Tests fairly reflected the material and homework and the book was an easy and interesting read.",
                    "I suppose it helps a bit that I was already interested in linguistics, but I liked the way the class was structured around each of the different branches of linguistics.",
                    "The material is interesting and in a field with which few students will have prior experience. It is well-presented and clearly explained.",
                    "This course was a light and interesting introduction to the field of linguistics and my eyes were opened to the incredible complexity and subtlety of language and all its facents.",

                    "There was a lot of interesting material in this course. I'd never really had much interest in linguistics, but took it on the urging of a friend and actually thought it was really good. I wasn't crazy about the group project for the sole reason of it being so difficult in such a large class to organize something, but otherwise most of the material covered was great and provided a kind of sampler of the different facets of linguistics. I didn't feel like anything got cheated out of time either, the time spent on each section was just perfect.",
                    "A few of the questions on the homeworks were a bit vague, but nothing particularly serious.",
                    "The course covered a good variety of topics and is what you'd expect from an intro class.",
                    "Interesting stuff, I took this class because a friend recommended it, and had a different professor and learned completely different things than were taught the semester before. A lot of variance depending on the professor.",

                    "The course was efficiently taught, and I learned a lot of basics about the study of linguistics. It gave me a good idea of what future courses will be like if i choose to pursue this area of interest.",
                    "This course was very a very extensive introduction the study of linguistics. At times it was interesting, but at other times I thought it was a bit boring and common sense. I certainly enjoyed the end where we learned about the different dialects in America.",

                    "The class was organized but the material was not presented in the best way.",
                    "The course material was very interesting to me, especially the phonetics and phonology sections. However, the lectures were more or less unnecessary as the powerpoints were posted on the website and one could simply study off of that. The readings were also a bit pointless seeing that one could get a good grade without actually reading anything.",

This is a must-take for anyone interested in language, psychology, or human interaction in general.",
                    "The material was easy to understand, the topics were interesting and ones I had never come in contact with (being an engineer). I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good distribution credit.",
                    "The material in this course is relatively basic but comprehensive. As long as you put some effort into it, nothing is really too hard to understand.",
                    "I enjoyed the content which took us through a a scientific introduction to the subject ending with the social effects that it has. Material was interesting for the most part, and homeworks were actually fun to do - they take principles discussed and apply them but in a very playful, quizzing type manner, that does in fact help you learn it.",
                    "Great course- easy to follow and interesting material.",
                    "I enjoyed this class. The workload was relatively lighter than most classes you will take at Rice, and the subject matter is for the most part interesting.",

                    "This class wasn't very difficult, but the grading system was somewhat irrational. The heaviest percentage of your grade was the hw, and while it wasn't hard hw, it was time consuming and very easy to make mistakes on. Sometimes I felt it was graded unfairly. Otherwise, it was a good intro course.",
                    "good introductory course to linguistics",
                    "The course material was kept at a simple enough level to be managable, but was still very interesting.",
                    "This class introduces some fairly interesting topics ranging from word morphology to phonetics to social registers and speech and almost everything in between. Dr. Achard uses powerpoints to lecture, and these can all be found on the ANTH 200 website, so if you miss a class it's not the end of the world. Going to class does however have its merits, as the notes online usually do not provide as much detail or explanation as Dr. Achard does in class. Often, he also uses handouts with linguistic problems on them to supplement his lecture. These are often similar to homework and test problems and are therefore quite useful. There were about seven homeworks, three midterms (non-cumulative), and a paper. The last midterm takes place the last day of classes. These exams are usually quite straightforward if you were conscious during his lectures and if you take the time to read over some of the details in the text as a review. He teaches a lot straight out of the text, so the book is quite handy.",
                    "This course is very interesting for anyone wanting a broad survey of basic linguistics and the major topics in that field of study. It covers a lot of topics in not very much detail, including phonetics, phonology, semantics, syntax, sociolinguistics, language evolution, and more. It's a good class that doesn't require very much work.",

                    "The comment that the final review session was canceled on short notice is entirely inaccurate. The final review session was not canceled at all. It was held on the last day of classes, as scheduled in the syllabus which all students received on the first day of class. (They could also download the syllabus from OWL-Space in case they lost their copy or were not present on the first day of classes.) I conducted the final review as scheduled, and the TAs were also present. At the end of the review, the take-home final exams were distributed to all students present. I did have to cancel my office hours during the final exam study period due to being invited for a last-minute job interview in another state. Ideally I would have been on-campus during the entire study period, but I cannot realistically turn down a job interview in the current economic situation. However, I canceled the office hours only after confirming that the TAs would be available in my absence. I made it clear to students via OWL-Space and e-mail that while I would be off-campus, I would be in contact via e-mail, telephone, or OWL-Space to answer any questions. Since only one student had taken advantage of my office hours during the entire semester, I was confident that cancellation of my physical office hours would not be disastrous. I received no requests for help via e-mail or any other media. The only difficulty reported to me was that one student scheduled a time to visit the TAs during office hours but never showed up (despite the TA waiting for him/her all day).",

                    "The course was organized fairly well. My main issue with the course structure is that homework assignments were not returned in a timely manner, and it became difficult to complete a homework assignment that built on the previous one when the previous assignment had not yet been returned.",

It'll be better if you do the required reading before-hand since you'll have to do then eventually when you do the homeworks. The homeworks helped a lot in the understanding of the materials. It was an interesting change from my regular engineering classes and I would recommend this class to the other engineers.",

The curriculum follows the textbook extremely closely, which results in a class which is very organized if a bit bland at times. To break things up I felt the TAs could have taught more than just once each, because I felt they were good instructors too. The most interesting parts of this course were at the very beginning with learning IPA and the respective problem sets, and also at the very end with the language acquisition and language endangerment sections. Much of the other material in the class I felt was not really that substancial.",

The class was powerpoint based, which made things rushed at times, but there were plenty of in class demonstrations that made things more enjoyable. The homework assignments did a very good job of making sure you understood the material. The midterm and final were comprehensive and were on Owlspace, which is still a service in need of more improvements before it can work without any glitches. The class also seems to be taught at a slightly harder level than the other Ling 200 classes. Regardless, this was an outstanding class.",
                    "The subject material in this introductory linguistics class was very, very interesting. For those out there who find how words, conversation, and language develop intriguing, this class is for you. As one taking the class as a DII elective, I found that it presented me with a source of new, exciting subject material compared to my other classes.",

I guess that depends on the person, and I have reached conclusion that I am just probably not that good at Linguistics and I work hard but it doesn't seem to be very effective.",
                    "I thought this was a pretty easy distribution course. Some parts of the material were really interesting. I particularly appreciated the units in this course that gave me a new perspective on English and foreign languages. Show up to lectures, because you're going to learn most of what you need to know there. You don't have to read that much of the textbook; I mostly used it as a reference.",

                    "As a potential Linguistics major, I definitely found the material taught in the class to be interesting and useful. The class gives a good taste of the different fields of Linguistics. Definitely take it if you are considering majoring in Linguistics as it is a prerequisite for most upper level classes.",
                    "Interesting topic, sometimes the lectures were boring.",
                    "A good introductory course to those interested in Linguistics, and a course that can be fairly interesting even to those who have no conscious desire to learn more about Linguistics (yours truly included). The class gives a pretty balanced overview of the major areas in Linguistics study; though it does not go into terrible depth, it nevertheless reveals enough about the field and leaves enough open and unanswered questions to possibly warrant additional interest from the student.",

It made me more aware of our amazing ability to create and use languages. 50% of the grade is 8 homework assignments and the rest is based on a midterm and a final. The homework can be a bit challenging at times but going to office hours helps. Overall I'd highly recommend this class.",

The TA's were awful and could not explain what to do or what we did wrong as a class. They also took forever to grade the homeworks, which counts for half of your grade, so you didn't know where you stood in the class until it was too late in the semester to do anything about it. Lectures were random and often times boring.",

                    "The only thing I didn't like about this course was that the homework assignments counted for so much of the final course grade. The homework assignments were graded by TA's, and some of the TA's seemed to be more lenient with their grading than others.",

                    "This course didn't require a whole lot of work. Reading the book to do the homework each week was more than enough for me to do fine on both of the two tests. Would have been interesting with a less monotone teacher.",

Chapters in the book are typically twenty pages long, and in that time it only manages to say something like: You use more slang when your around your peers than around adults, and you write even more formally. In multilingual societies, the same thing happens, except its different languages altogether rather than slang/formality. Basically its all common sense.",

Your grade is made up of one quiz, one final, weekly homeworks, and participation, so plan on attending most lectures. Reading the textbook is not necessary since all the info you need is on the PowerPoint slides which are posted online, but the homeworks can be somewhat time-consuming for a D2 if your goal is an A.",

                    "I really enjoyed Ling 200. Some of the lectures were a bit dry every now and then, but Dr. Englebretson kept things interesting with his humor. There's basically a homework assignment due every week or so- they take probably around 2-3 hours for each one. They really do help you understand the material as you work through them (especially morphology). If I had to make one change to the course, though, it would be about the phonetics homework. It's *very* difficult, and most people failed it (which was par for the course, we were told). To make it a bit more \"passable\", I think the format of it should be changed slightly (converting IPA into English? Having the students transcribe some, but not all, of a word?). The way the course works, your lowest HW grade is dropped, but with few exceptions, the Phonetics homework will be the worst HW grade, so the whole \"We'll drop your lowest\" kind of translates to \"We'll drop the phonetics HW grade\", which makes the policy a bit misleading, IMO. That's a really minor gripe, though. This class was pretty great overall, and aside from that one particular assignment, I thought the other assessments in the class were really fair (and not all that difficult).",

                    "The work load for this class was very manageable and pretty interesting for a D2 credit. A majority of the class grade was dependent upon the homeworks which made doing the homework more beneficial.",

                    "Great course -- we covered linguistic tools and methods for studying language in the first half of the course and analyzed sociolinguistics and language ideology in the second half. Assignments were helpful, midterm and final were fair.",
                    "Really enjoyful course. Lectures are so interesting and fun. Also, this course has 6 hws and 2 exams. All exams are take home. Each homework takes at most 3 hours to finish.",
                    "This is a good class. The first half of the semester in particular. It seemed like the second half lost the organization and structure of the first half and lectures stopped being posted online, but it was still manageable and lectures were always entertaining. I was definitely not a fan of the essay-style final exam, and was expecting an exam more like the midterm.",
                    "Super chill class and I feel like it was a good intro to linguistics! Professor Taylor is awesome, definitely take intro ling with him. We had several hw assignments that made up 60% of our grade, a take home midterm, and a take home final paper that was very short- 2-3 pages.",
                    "This class is a good intro to linguistics for people who do not want to focus on the detailed phonetics and IPA material. We learned about and had homework on IPA, morphology, phonology, syntax, etc., but closer to the end of the semester, the class began to broaden and explain the use of linguistics in everyday life and in a social context more than just the actual study of the structure of language, which is useful for people who are not linguistics majors but are still interested in the topic. Go to class! And pay attention! The PowerPoints he presents in class will really help on assignments. One midterm (take home), a few homeworks (all pretty easy as long as you go to class and use the slides after), two essay style homeworks (1-2 pages), and a final essay. Overall a good intro class that really helped me understand the role of language in society.",
                    "LING 200 was organized with 8 homeworks (every two weeks), a take-home midterm, and a final essay. However, Dr. Taylor had multiple conflicts this semester, so we had less homeworks assigned. Generally, the first part of the course (more intro to linguistics) was really interesting, and the homeworks were like puzzles. The second part (more anthropology) was on sociolinguistics and was not as interesting and seemed redundant and circular in explanation. Overall though, I enjoyed the course, and I was pretty entertained throughout the course. Dr. Taylor tells pretty funny jokes in class!",
                    "Professor Taylor is really funny and makes you think. This was a very entertaining class, a good balance to all of the boring/hard classes that we are required to take",
                    "This was one of the most laid-back classes I've ever taken at Rice. There were 5-6 assignments that were pretty short and not too challenging. There was only one take home test and one take home final. It's a class that involves very little work but still is interesting, and Dr. Taylor is really flexible about allowing students to push back exams.",

                    "So this course was very interesting. The bulk of your grade comes from your homework which at times can be a bit challenging. The second half of the semester is very interesting when you are on the topic of sociolinguistics which the professors research interest.",

                    "You do not learn anything in this class. There is essentially no work so if you want an easy class, this one is great. However, it is harder to get an A+ because there are only a few assignments and they do not have a lot of questions so if you get one wrong, that's probably a whole point off of your final",

Only one midterm and a final, and an extra-credit option that was pretty fun to write. In class was usually on the boring side, but the book was easy to understand. Take a lot of time on the homework because that's where most of the learning happens. If you're interested in language or just want a slightly more challenging distribution take this class! It's worth the work, you'll learn a lot",

                    "This was a good overview of linguistics. Some units were more interesting than others. We never stayed on one unit for too long, so the particularly boring units (historical linguistics, language preservation) passed by quickly. We had nine homework assignments, the lowest of which is dropped from our grade. It is pretty difficult to get full score on the assignments without help from a TA, especially if you skipped class. The professor goes through example problems in class which is EXTREMELY valuable. Definitely try to go to class! Both exams were on Owlspace and were of fair difficulty. I'd say the worst part is having to memorize the IPA alphabet. That was horrific.",

Not too much work at all, I'd say (or guarantee).",

The six homework assignments all contributed to my learning the material. The midterm was multiple choice, and the final was an essay. I learned a lot about linguistics - phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse, sociolinguistics, and attitudes (the latter two also taught extended over an entire semester as LING 205). The most difficult part for me was phonetics and phonology as mastery of the names of sounds based on anatomical terms and the IPA transcription was more difficult.",

He doesn't always stick to the PowerPoint, but he does post the PowerPoints online for reference later.

                    "It was interesting and well designed except there was a bit much homework for a distribution course. Also grade cutoffs were ridiculous - had to pass fail because cutoff for an A was so high and she made it clear she doesn't like to curve.",
                    "This class is simply an introductory course to the study of linguistics. The material itself was more or less a whirlwind of topics as we spent no more than a week on each unit (which in itself could be a semester\u2019s worth of information). The homework assignments were a little bit tedious, especially for those who were planning on taking the class just for distribution, but they were very interesting and really got you engaged with thinking about the class material. The tests were pretty easy and the unexpected curve at the end really boosted everyone\u2019s scores.",
                    "This course has high workload. There are 3 exams (in-class), homework (each week), and 2 reports. The class was harder than I expected but you will definitely learn a lot about linguistics.",
                    "The course material was quite interesting, and I learned a lot about a fascinating topic. However, I would advise against taking this course as a distribution (unless you use a pass/fail) because it is entirely too much work, and is NOT a good GPA booster. Seriously, an A started at 95, and to get an A+ required a 100%, which is just not possible. There is also no rounding, as the syllabus explicitly states: \"an 89.987 is a B+, not an A-\". The problem sets could be challenging and often tedious (Dr. Oko insisted we type up and print out our problem sets, which got pretty time-consuming when they used lots of IPA symbols like '\u02a7'). Also, the exams were nothing like the problem sets, and don't EVER miss a day in this class, because every day is important, and the lecture notes will never be posted online.",
                    "This course was much more work than I had realized for an introductory course. The homework was graded just as harshly as the tests and both were a significant portion of the grade distribution.",
                    "Ling 200 was much more difficult than I expected, and unfortunately class time did not prepare us for the homework assignments. These homework assignments would take 6+ hours each week to complete, and the final typed versions were often 7 or 8 pages in length. A lot of these assignments I felt were mainly busy work and did not supplement what we did in class. The TA's graded very harshly, and even though I attended office hours frequently, I still did poorly on many of the assignments. The class was also poorly organized, and the lectures very scattered.",
                    "This course was very poor. I went to all the lectures, but often found myself wondering why I was wasting my time there. No matter how much or little I paid attention in class/read the textbook/checked my answers with others, I would get a HW grade in the low 90s. The TAs took off for very small things. Getting an A is almost impossible, as you need a 95 with no rounding up. I feel like I would have enjoyed linguistics if the course was better, but unfortunately it was miserable.",
                    "Homeworks were not reflective of what was taught in class. They were very long and tedious and graded quite harshly. Tests were not too bad and were reflective of the study guide but still not easy, a lot of studying was required to do well.",
                    "Distribution requirements shouldn't be this hard",
                    "I really enjoyed the course material and genuinely liked what we were learning, but I do think the class is unnecessarily difficult. As an intro-level class, the expectations are unreasonably high and EVERYTHING is graded for accuracy. I've spent 8 hours on a homework assignment before, the night before I also had a 10-page paper due. Definitely start assignments as soon as you get them and go to TA office hours.",
                    "This class was far too difficult for an intro class. Had I not pass/failed the class, I would have really struggled. The graders were definitely too harsh grading the homework assignments.",
                    "Grading is very inconsistent. Class and teaching is disorganized. Oko doesn't provide students with the skills necessary to complete assignments, so students have to teach themselves most of the material. Only take this course if you have to. Ridiculous expectations for 200 level course. One of the worst classroom experiences I've ever had. Would NOT recommend. Take with any other professor besides Oko.",
                    "Really cool class and interesting material. Highly recommend for distribution credit or just for fun. Workload is manageable- 1 homework a week, 2 short reports, 3 tests. Material is usually presented effectively.",
                    "This course ended up being a lot more intensive than previous iterations had led me to believe - this was mainly because of the length of the homework assignments, which typically took around 10 hours per week. There is a lot of essential reading and discussion that needs to happen outside the classroom. The homework assignments were also graded unforgivingly, which is justified but demoralizing. It's not fun seeing a C on an assignment that you spent more time on than the classes required for your major during that week.",
                    "A lot to learn, most of them new and not common knowledge. Not an easy distribution class, you need 95 for an A. Homework questions are tricky and reading dry. Basically, everything talked about in class is based on the reading; if you didn't do the reading, it is really difficult because you cannot get much out of the lecture. The lecture is more of a practice and extension of textbook knowledge. The last chapter on language documentation is entirely based on professor's experience, relatively useless",
                    "I really did not enjoy this course. Most of class was spent going over barely relevant material in a disorganized way, making us really unprepared to complete the ridiculously long and challenging weekly homework assignments.",
                    "Lectures didn't help at all, went way off topic and no one paid attention anyway. Didn't like the group activities, they were a waste of time. Homeworks were WAY too long and we were expected to read and learn the textbook on our own. She had no idea what she was assigning."

                    "Homework assignment due once a week that was pretty long. While class seemed to drag on some earlier in the semester, later in the semester it got more interesting. Learned a lot.",
                    "i loved this class -- it's why i'm considering being a ling major. it was very interesting and also pretty chill (i think some sections with different professors were harder than mine). the lectures were interesting and some of the homework was fun if you like word game-like stuff.",
                    "This course dramatically changed the way I think about language. We would cover a topic in class, and then I would start noticing items from the lecture taking place in conversations all around me. I learned a lot and I can't wait to learn more.",
                    "This class is interesting but does require time to do the homework and understand what is going on in class outside of class.",
                    "The homework assignments were pretty hard; they were often on material that we hadn't learned in class. But there was only about one assignment every two weeks. Interesting concepts.",
                    "I did not like this class because I thought it was tedious and boring. I found it pointless listening to a lecture about phonemes and morphemes. I took this class for a distribution credit for DII and I would not recommend. If you want an easy DII take some other class. The homework was especially tedious because you had to transcribe conversations and analyze sentences. Do not be fooled by the interesting title of this class!",
                    "There were ten homework assignments with a take-home midterm and final. The homework assignments were never too difficult, although some lacked explanation of what exactly was expected. The class is very obviously an intro level class in that it is a broad overview of many different topics in linguistics. This is good in that if you don't like a topic, you won't be stuck with it for long.",
                    "The content was varied in terms of level of interest, but the more tedious subjects were clearly things we needed to learn. Overall, the course was a great introduction to many aspects of linguistics- a field not everyone is familiar with.",
                    "This course was so refreshing and interesting. It was definitely my favorite class this semester. I had no idea what Linguistics was about before taking this course, but after completing it, I definitely want to take more classes in the field and get involved in Ling research.",
                    "ANTH 200 is definitely a LING class more than an ANTH class... but it is still interesting.",
                    "It wasn't until the end of te semester that the topics discussed began to be more interesting. The overall grade is largely dependent on the homework assignment, but sometimes to topics on the homework were discussed after it was due. The textbook is extremely dry but at times, it was the only source of reference for the homework assignments.",
                    "Dr. Niedz dropped the ball a few times in keeping the class organized as she had it on the syllabus. But I don't think it's fair to say that's entirely a flaw, because that was mainly due to her willingness to spend time answering student questions and to go off on tangents a bit to bring in other meaningful or interesting aspects of linguistics to the lecture. The homeworks initially were a little bit too long and fairly difficult, but she toned them down later, and with 10 in total it really wasn't bad. Lectures were usually pretty interesting, but she could go into stretches where it was difficult to stay focused. When she was on a roll and was able to facilitate some interaction with the class, though, it was great.",
                    "This class was kind of unorganized, but still enjoyable. There was usually a homework due every week, and they could take a pretty long amount of time, but they helped cement the material, and the professor let you drop one. Lectures were fairly interesting, but it was easy to get off topic and behind the syllabus.",
                    "I learned a lot in Ling 200. There was so much info to cover that we tended to go through it very quickly, but the homework really helped me to learn the information through it's application. The textbook was somewhat helpful, but in reality she goes over everything in class and if you're a quick learner you don't have to do all the reading. I love how homework is most of the class and we get to drop our lowest grade, and the tests have been fairly doable. She was very responsive to those who didn't have time to finish the midterm and let us take the final online which means I got to go home early!",
                    "This class was interesting at times and tedious at other times. The schedule deviated from the syllabus often, and the slides often weren't posted on time, which they needed to be because of the speed we took going over the notes.",
                    "I think the first half of this class that includes exercises and puzzles more than general discussion is more interesting than the latter half. The class was pretty unorganized, however, and we got about a month behind in the material at one point. There are a lot of misconceptions about language that are cleared up in this course, making it an informative look into pop culture through the eyes of a linguist. The class changes the way you look at the world, even if you don't love the material. I think I would have enjoyed the class more as a whole if it had been more organized.",

There were 2 online take-home exams and an online cumulative final (all closed notes). There were 11 Modules throughout the course, each due at the end of the week. They consisted of reading a few articles or watching a video, and then a self-assessment. They were completion grades. The course was organized and Dr. E stuck to the syllabus.",

There are modules every week that are completion grades (but doing them is definitely encouraged because it's a great way to study for the exams), two midterm exams, and a final. It's easy to do well if you go to class, pay attention, and do the weekly modules!",
                    "The subject matter for this class was interesting, but it could have been presented in a more engaging way. Workload was very light - there was a module due every week (for completion) and 2 midterms and a final. Most of the lectures were just repeats of the slides and the chapters in the book. The only difficult portion of the class is phonetics, but other than that, not too bad.",
                    "Good intro course, light workload, kinda boring even if you find linguistics interesting though just because of course format.",
                    "This was a very interesting course--I wish I'd taken it before senior year so I could've taken more linguistics electives. As an overview of linguistics, it moves quickly, but I didn't feel that any topic was particularly rushed. Topics ranged from sociolinguistics (such as the way that dialects can alter the results of trials) to phonetics. Somewhat to my surprise, the part I enjoyed most was morphology analysis; it's really cool to take 10-20 carefully chosen samples from a completely unfamiliar language, and deduce a handful of words, the basics of their grammar structure, and a set of word order requirements until you can construct new, correct sentences in that language.",
                    "This is a good distribution class. It's not too much work, but you should be prepared for a lot of memorization if you want an A.",

                    "The subject material is very interesting, esepcially in the lectures. The textbook could be dry/confusing, but the lectures were very clear. The class does take some work outside of class hours, since the two midterms and one final do cover material from lectures and the textbook, and students are expected to solve some \"puzzles\" for each test, but it doesn't take up too much time. Overall, a very good choice for a D2.",
                    "Class has a pretty light workload, but that can lead to neglect to study material on own time. There are not really assignments in the class, only weekly modules.",
                    "The class grade consisted of 11 homework (multiple choice, graded on a completed/uncompleted basis), two exams, and one final. The course didn't deviate much from the material in the book so it was easy to go back and reference the things we talked about.",

The slower-pace of the course is what makes it easy to follow; just make sure you don't fall behind in the phonology sections. The book is a good resource if you don't understand something, but you really just need to understand the class material in order to do well on the tests (although the class material corresponds pretty well to chapters in Txbk). Easy B, tricky A.",

Even if you aren't planning to take any other linguistics classes or if you don't know anything about linguistics, this is still a great class to take.",

The class isn't impossible, though it is definitely a trickier class. Memorizing IPA is the roughest part of the year. Tests could be somewhat difficult but they were always fair.",

I think it was Dr. E's first time using canvas, and I wonder if in future semesters he will modify the course to make it more essential to come to class or to make the material more difficult (because the way it was taught this semester made class attendance unnecessary). It's somewhat interesting too! Would recommend as easy D2.",

                    "Depending on your professor, LING 200 can be really great (or not, so I've heard). Achard does a great job of preparing you and teaching concepts (and presenting them in memorable ways not the same as the textbook). Definitely go to class, even if it's a lecture and technically no one will know if you miss it. LING 200 is generally an easier class, but still requires some effort. It's focused more on concepts with a little bit of technical analysis (~20%) problems. The key is doing all the modules, and remembering the details of case studies. Our class had weekly modules for a completion grade, chapter readings from the textbook, two midterms, and a final exam. You should definitely read *all* the articles and watch the videos linked on the modules, as they will come up in midterms/final even if not mentioned anywhere else, as well as do the textbook readings if you want to know what's happening. I found that class was the best for learning the analysis problems (how to identify allophones and phonemes, etc.). Overall the class is very chill, and does a brief survey of different topics covered in linguistics like phonetics, sociolinguistics, first language acquisition, pragmatics, semantics, etc.",
                    "It's a fun course, great as an introduction to linguistics. I definitely learned a lot.",
                    "This was a really fun course. The material was interesting and taught in a compelling way (even with the large class size). The weekly module was mostly for my benefit in studying for the test and was easy to complete. I would recommend this course to anyone (even if you're not particularly interested in languages) because of the engaging material.",
                    "Very interesting class, there was a lot of material to cover, and I'm pretty sure we barely scratched the surface.",
                    "Interesting subject material; the PowerPoint lecture format is not always the most engaging but a good professor helps a lot",
                    "I loved this class - it's the first one I've taken in Linguistics, and I thought the material was very interesting. Additionally, the workload was not too hard, and the weekly modules helped reinforce the material without overburdening you with respect to time. I would highly recommend this course, especially if you're interested in linguistics!",
                    "The instructor is really nice to us and know the material very well.",
                    "This course was an excellent introduction to linguistics. The weekly modules helped me keep up with the readings and are good study tools for the exams.",
                    "If you're genuinely interested in linguistics, you will learn a lot and Professor Achard is really great. If you're looking for an easy D2, you don't have to go to class & you can read over his powerpoints right before the test and you'll do well in the class.",
                    "It is an interesting class.",
                    "LING 200 isn't too demanding as a course. It serves its purpose as an introductory course. You're introduced to various fields of linguistics such as Morphology, Phonetics, Phonology, and Historical Linguistics. The only assignments you really have are the online modules that are once a week. There are 2 online midterms and a final. It's a very manageable course, and I would recommend it to anyone who shows interest in the subject.",
                    "This class is great but not as easy as you would think. You learn a lot of things and ways to think that you are probably not familiar with. Therefore, it is really important for you to go to class or at least go through the powerpoints (Prof Achard posts all of them on canvas). The phonetics stuff was honestly the most difficult for me (Making sounds with your mouth can be kinda hard if you've never tried to keep track of where your tongue is, how round your mouth is, etc). Overall, it was interesting in the end (when I actually went through the powerpoints)! The logic-puzzle stuff was fun!",
                    "Straight forward course. If you read the book or pay attention in class you will do well while learning some new things. Great D2.",
                    "A solid D2 class. Go to class and you'll do fine.",
                    "The topics of this course were interesting in general, but exams were so heavily memorization based and certain units like phonetics were just tedious to learn. There was so much material crammed into every lecture, but as an intro course, I understand that this may not be so flexible.",
                    "I felt that as an intro class this was way too technical. Did enjoy the fact that different media was used to teach the class (at times we would read the textbook, use the class presentations, read different online articles, or watch videos).",
                    "The material was always interesting and the workload was relatively light (11 completion-based modules, supplementary textbook reading). I definitely needed to study for the exams- two midterms and a final- but overall I enjoyed the course and would take another linguistics class.",
                    "Covers a wide breath of linguistics. If you have poor memory skills, spend extra time on the IPA unit. You [need] to have the IPA chart memorized.",

                    "LING 200 is a really interesting class. The class is quite simple, but it requires some thought to be put into it. The material is simple to understand, but the quantity can be overwhelming sometimes.",
                    "I was very surprised by this course. It made me look at language in a completely new way and challenged me to learn new skills that I wouldn't have learned otherwise.",
                    "This is not only a great option for a distribution class, but some really interesting material. It is very broad, stimulating, and not too difficult if you put the effort into paying attention in class.",
                    "While this course seems pretty easy because there isn't much work week to week, be warned that the second test is hard especially if you don't study a lot or memorize the IPA. (Hint: YOU SHOULD MEMORIZE THE IPA.) Overall it's a good introduction to linguistics and the articles/resources in the modules are always interesting and relevant.",
                    "The course goes through the basics of linguistics (as it suggests) and does a pretty good job of presenting the material in the best light it can. Get ready to learn the International Phonetic Alphabet, though, and all the different ways the mouth moves in order to make those sounds, because if you don't, you'll be lost for quite a bit later on. That being said, there was a lot of interesting things that I really enjoyed learning about, and if I were to ever build my own language, I know what to keep in mind. A great class to take as a D2.",
                    "It's a good and interesting course (especially if you need a D2).",
                    "This course is pretty easy but it is easy to push to the side and ignore until it is too late. It was somewhat difficult to pay attention because I don't particularly care for the material. Some parts were a little more interesting that others but overall somewhat of a dry course. None of this is the professors fault, however! He was actually really passionate and always tried hard to engage and help the students. Take the course but try to keep up with the material and you will be fine, especially so you're not stressing the material last minute.",
                    "The material and readings matched well and the weekly modules helped check understanding. Having said this, the lack of assignments makes it easy to fall behind and then you have to cram for tests.",

                    "The lecture was very informative and I learned a lot about linguistics that I didn't know before.",
                    "I think this is probably an interesting class if you are interested in pursuing linguistics further, and I did think it was mildly interesting, I just also thought the material was very intuitive, like you could take the exam and pass even without having done anything for the class, because it's just makes sense. In that way, I didn't feel like I was necessarily learning anything new, so I wasn't that interested in it. Overall a good class if you don't want too much work, except for memorizing the IPA chart.You don't even necessarily have to go to class, and I know plenty of people who didn't.",
                    "This class was just very boring to me as a subject. I signed up for this to take an Anthropology course while getting distribution only for me to find out that it really is focused more on linguistics than anth. It's an easy class, but I never was able to engage in it so I found it very boring.",
                    "This class is a great intro for those who are interested in Linguistics and even for those who just want an interesting D2 course.",
                    "Grades are based on two midterm exams, one cumulative final exam and 11 modules (completion grade). This course is a good introduction to linguistics.",
                    "Ling 200 is an amazing course. Recommended to anyone. Language is something that isn't usually thought about on a scientific level, but it is fascinating to do so.",
                    "The material itself is very interesting but there is a lot of it presented in a short amount of time. A lot of the learning is also based on examples which are hard to remember and articulate making the material somewhat difficult to grasp.",
                    "Modules are due every Friday, you could literally submit them blank. I definitely let myself get behind because of this. Class was pretty engaging, not my favorite subject. T/TH made the lectures feel pretty long. Tests are on Canvas, not too bad.",
                    "It was a solid distribution course that actually piqued my interest in linguistics. There is so much more than learning syntax or how humans pronounce words. This class pushes you to learn, especially the IPA table, to truly understand how language works in forming society and the connections that define language interaction today.",
                    "This is a great course for distribution credit. It is fairly easy and is usually interesting.",
                    "2 exams, weekly due module test (completion credit only, so it is very easy). slides can be better organized, but overall a good intro/D2 class. Not much workload, but the class does cover a lot of things."

                    "The material was not the most interesting, and I think this was mainly because it was not presented in an interesting way. The lectures were dry and the textbook was often difficult to follow, since the book was filled with lots of unnecessary information.",

The class was just three exams and weekly modules (graded for completion). Dr. Durian is not the greatest lecturer but he is very receptive to emails and I think he would probably be better one-on-one, like in office hours. The lectures consisted pretty exclusively of Dr. Durian reading off of his handouts. Answering the practice questions in class could help if you had questions but otherwise did not really feel worth it (coming from someone who actually went to class).",

And every week you have a \"module\" which you can take with other people and with notes to \"test\" your knowledge of what you should've learned from lecture/the book. Honestly, lectures felt useless as I only went to show face and tuned him out and I still did okay. If you need to take this course and the other professor is an option, take it with him bc all you will get in these lectures is him reading from his \"handouts\" and him not being able to respond to questions asked by those in the lecture.",

                    "I thought the course was poorly designed.

The professor mostly read off of the handouts, and there were so many typos on them. He was also new this year, so he didn't exactly know how to work Canvas sometimes for our exams. I felt like I could easily learn the material on my own time with the book and the handouts.",
                    "I took this course as a graduation requirement, and as a science major, I found the class refreshing. The material taught was generally a nice introduction to the study of linguistics, and you can tell that mostly nonmajors take the course. All the information presented in class came from the textbook and/or his handouts; all of that information is covered on weekly quizzes. Three exams, including the final, count for 75% of your overall grade. Not a difficult course to take, BUT you definitely have to work in the class in order to get an A.",
                    "The course is really well structured, and there's clear continuity between the handouts you go over in class and the chapters you're learning in the book. The exams are completely reasonable if you have a decent understanding of the material. This was a great distribution class that didn't overwhelm me with work.",

                    "The course load was about the same/maybe even lighter in comparison to my other introduction classes. The topics get more interesting as the year progresses but the textbook can be long-winded as it covers a lot of material. This course was definitely not my most intriguing class but it's a fairly easy A as long as students complete the modules and study for exams.",

It really wasn't necessary to go to lecture because the professor read directly off of a handout that was posted online. Also, our homework was just completion so our grades were really just based off three exams. I took this class because I was interested in the topic, but I can't say I really learned much. I would not recommend taking this class unless you are really interested in linguistics.",

The material can be confusing at times, but the class is fairly easy, especially since we didn't have to memorize the IPA alphabet. There are three online exams covering about a third of the material each time and they were pretty easy, though they covered quite a bit of information. Attending the class is pretty pointless because the instructor just reads off the handouts that he posts online. It is necessary to read the book to do well on the exams, but the handouts cover most of the necessary information. Besides reading the book, the class is very low workload as there are just short weekly modules to complete and that's it. Class is completely lecture format and is pretty boring. It is a good introductory class to see if you are interested in linguistics or not.",

Durian did not do a good job of presenting the material, so I often found myself unable to pay attention in class, especially since he read word for word off the handouts.

I enjoyed learning about things like phonetics, phonology, morphology and syntax, as well as socio-linguistics and language contact/change. The structure and pace of the course seemed pretty reasonable. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy Dr. Durian's teaching at all, so the class was not as good as it could have been.",

We had weekly modules (open note self-assessment quizzes) to complete based on the material we learned that past week, but beyond that and reading there is not much homework. Significant portions of all three exams tested us more on brute memorization and close, nitpicky reading than conceptual material, which makes the process unnecessarily tedious.",
                    "I thought this class was really interesting. Coming to class was not completely necessary because most of the lecture material was also covered in the textbook and in online handouts, but the topics were really fascinating and the workload wasn't too heavy. You do have to do a little bit every week, or else you will get overwhelmed before the test. Overall, I'd recommend to someone who wants a relatively easy/cool distribution.",

This would have been fine, but it made it difficult to study for the exams as it was hard to tell what was important, and what was on the homework for the hell of it. The exams were decent overall, though they did have a few questions that felt like memorization instead of actual learning. (Ex: At what age does a baby develop this very specific language feature. This is something that is easy to look up, and doesn't show any mastery of the subject, only memorization)",

                    "I learned a lot of information and the class was very interesting, but the reason I didn't rate the class outstanding was because with certain topics, the professor wasn't able to effectively teach the class and left a lot of us confused",
                    "Presented the material in a very uninteresting manner. By October only 25 people or so went to class out of upwards of 150. The first half of the course was effectively equivalent to 8th grammar class. It only got interesting after we all starting skipping. Super easy though",

There were handouts for every class, but almost all of them had problems (typos/incorrect info) that had to be fixed later. The textbook this semester changed to Language Files, which was great for some chapters and unhelpful for others. Because there was a weekly module that covered the same material as the lecture, I found it easier to just wait for the typos in the handout to be corrected than go to lecture.",
                    "The material for the course is fairly interesting. I took this course just because I thought the topic was interesting, but I don't think I would take it given what I know now. There are better intro-level D2's out there. I'm not sure how much I actually took away from this course. It's an odd mixture of very basic material, sprinkled with fairly advanced topics that are difficult to understand. I can't recommend this course.",

                    "The class itself isn't too interesting, but this subject is pretty interesting and is more than just learning grammar as some may think. I liked the social, psychological and cultural applications, as well as the technical aspects of sound production.",

                    "This class is really hit or miss. The course material is really interesting, but a little overwhelming if you're taking this class on top of other difficult classes. The concepts are not that easy to understand and I wish I had a bit more time to actually sit down and learn the material. Every test felt like a scramble to learn what I could so I could pass.",
                    "An enjoyable course. all of the content is interesting and engaging for the most part. Class lectures tended toward repetitive, especially in the first part of the semester, as the lectures were often simply an oral presentation of the worksheets, which were condensed overviews of the reading chapters (and sometimes indistinguishable from the practice chapters in the reading itself). However this could be an advantage as it reinforced the content of the course.",
                    "Personally, the course was not extremely interesting, but it was organized and the workload was manageable.",
                    "Chill course. Very little work and I honestly never went to class after the first month of school. Nice D2",
                    "While there was some topics that were very interesting to learn and understand, other topics were a bit too vague. On a few occasions when presenting a student would ask why a question he was answering couldn't have a different answer and sometimes he would agree that it might be both depending on how you look at it.

                    "This was a rough semester for me so I'm sure I would have appreciated the material a lot more if I had actually gone to class... It is set up essentially so that you don't need to as long as you do the work outside of class a few days before the test.",
                    "The workload in this class was very manageable. It was an excellent introduction to linguistics.",
                    "boring",
                    "A good class, wish lectures were a bit more helpful. Generally lecture involved reading off handouts (summaries from the textbook usually). Not super difficult if you do the textbook readings, handout readings, and do practice problems before the exams.",
                    "This class was a decent introduction to linguistics, though the material felt dry at times. The lecturer was not much help, but the workload and exams were very manageable. Definitely worth taking overall.",

                    "This class covered awesome material but was taught poorly. Lecture consisted of Durian going over handouts that contained the essence of the required reading, line by line. At first, I thought he'd use the handouts as supplement to his slides or verbal lecture, but don't expect much of that. Weekly completion modules, two midterms, and a final. I stopped going to lecture to do the readings at my own accord (lecture contributed this little) and found I performed better.",
                    "I managed to get through this class without learning a single bit of linguistics. That's entirely my fault, but it kinda feels like it was easier than it should have been to just never go to class, never study, and still pass.",

                    "Here's the thing: this class the quintessential one you hear about in high school where they tell you \"In college you have to learn everything by yourself\". The material of the class is interesting (to me) but going to the actual lecture usually doesn't add much to your experience. Durian is a very knowledgeable guy, but he uses the same examples over and over again (baeg, shtrong, and many other ones that EVERYONE noticed were being said ALL THE TIME which was actually quite funny tbh). He does his best to make the class interesting, but all the material you need to pass is made available to you outside class in the textbook and the handouts. Organization was well-done and consistent, but getting myself out of bed to go to class was a bit of a struggle. All that being said, I'd recommend the class because the material itself is interesting and challenging but presented in a manageable way in the handouts.",
                    "This was a good class to take in getting an understanding of what linguistics is and the different fields that exist within the subject. The class itself can get a bit slow, especially because a lot of it is just reading off the handouts that are given already. The exams are all take-home and online, and they're not super difficult, but there aren't enough practice questions. The modules that are required each week are alright, supplemented with extra videos and articles. Overall an okay class, though you may find the classes themselves boring from time to time.",

                    "Prof. Durian read from straight from handouts in class and frequently confused students. Could not answer questions in a straight forward way and often backtracked.

                    "This course had a very light load. We had completion homeworks of 20 multiple choice questions due once a week, which were 25% of the grade. Then we had three exams, which were also each 25%. So if you did all the homeworks on time it was the same as a 100 on one of four exams. The exams themselves were pretty easy, mainly just memorization of the terms given on the study guides. Overall, I didn't learn a ton, but it's a good distribution if you're looking to boost your GPA.",
                    "I really liked how engaging Dr. Durian was through Canvas. He was very prompt and specific with his assignments, and there were consistent modules to be done on Canvas that made me accountable for the readings I had to do. I especially enjoyed the articles in the modules, there were topics I had no idea of. I learned a lot from the course- it is definitely frontloaded, so make sure you study the IPA well from the beginning of the course, so you only have to revisit it as the course progresses. It will come back again in the course.",

                    "I really like this class and would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore linguistics (even just a little). I was a junior and I wished I had taken it earlier. The content was new and interesting to me, and I learned so much about different aspects in linguistics, including language construction and acquisition. The course structure is clearly stated in the syllabus - do make sure you remember to complete the weekly modules, though. If you go to the class, it should not take you much time outside of the classroom to study. In overall, the course is organized well. The last 1/3 of the semester was a little confusing since the professor did not go through every problem in the handouts with us.",

I found that going to the lecture helped my understanding of the material even if the slides were posted online. Some test questions were over lecture-specific material (like videos that we watched) so going to lecture probably helped my grade.",

                    "Dr. Durian is cool, pay attention to examples in lecture because while he does put his slides on Canvas, the sets done in class are definitely tested and it will be harder for you if you start to skip (a lot of people end up doing it towards the end of the semester)",

After that, though, you should start showing up, because there are videos he shows that you won't be able to see anywhere else and that will show up on the exams. Good intro to lots of different facets of linguistics. Language and the Brain week is rough if you're squeamish.",
                    "I found it extremely hard to motivate myself to come to class because the material was already on Canvas and lectures seemed like they didn't provide much more than what was on the slide. If you are interested in linguistics, this will be a fun course for you, and I have learned a lot, but I found out fairly quickly that since it is an introductory course, you'll briefly go over a broad range of topics that you may or may not be intrigued by. The material is very simple to grasp and I found that studying for an exam took less than an hour, sitting with the study guide and the textbook the night before the exam. The odd due date of the weekly modules (5pm on a Friday, despite class being on Tues and Thurs) meant that I missed 3 modules out of 13, but since they're weighted at 25%, it dented my grade more harshly than I think is appropriate. Good course, not fantastic."

This is a great distribution class to take. It helped me broaden my general knowledge which is exactly what a distribution class is supposed to do. I think the breadth of the material is also adequate for a linguistic introduction course and should give you a good idea of the world of linguistics. There were 2 tests and a final exam. There were 11 modules that we due almost every week; these were not difficult and were meant to keep you on track in the class. Overall, I highly suggest taking this class.

It gave a great overview of various linguistic fields, including pragmatics, semantics, morphology, phonology, phonetics, syntax, sociolinguistics, language acquisition, language development and endangerment. Each week we had a short \"module\" that included a couple articles to read, sometimes a short video, and a 20ish multiple choice quiz that reinforced the concepts we covered that week (we only needed a 70% to get credit for the modules, so they were v chill). There were 2 midterms and one final, all three of which were take home and quite doable. I found the phonology unit a bit boring, since it involved a lot of memorization, but other than that, the class was pretty interesting! It involved more logic/puzzley stuff than I expected because we would analyze sets of words in foreign languages to determine sound or meaning patterns (kind of like a puzzle, so I found that fun). Also, the sociolinguistics, language acquisition, and language endangerment units were pretty cool, and much more similar to topics you would see in a psych or soci class. Overall, pretty good course!!",

Try to go to class, because Achard is a great lecturer, but honestly, just reviewing the slides should set you up well for the exams. Do you modules and spend some time with the material. If you treat this semi-seriously, you'll gain a lot out of the class, learn about the nuances of English and languages, and not have too hard of a time.",

                    "This class was interesting towards the beginning, but would always end up losing me half-way through. You can tell the instructor has a passion for this, which shows during his presentation, however, it was a lot of reading off the slides which was not interesting at all. We went through information pretty quickly, but the professor uploads the slides which is extremely helpful as there is never enough time to write/type it all down. On that note, if you miss lectures you will not be lost because he uploads the notes and that is exactly what he reads during the lecture.",
                    "I thought the class was pretty boring not going to lie. The lectures are very long and boring. If you are into linguistics you might enjoy it, but it was not my thing.",
                    "Memorizing stuff can get dry. But case studies of obscure languages and analyzing universal patterns are pretty fun. And bonus: now you can read the dictionary pronunciations with the weird upside down or slashed letters",
                    "Best-organized class I took at Rice this semester. Very well thought out slides and excellent presentation of the material. Convinced me to take another Linguistics class next semester!",
                    "I did not find this course particularly interesting. It is not super challenging but I rarely found myself super engaged. It was hard to focus in class and there was just a lot of memorization. All the exams are take home and you have to complete weekly modules that are graded based on completion. I think there are more interesting D2 distribution courses you can take, but if you are looking for an introduction to linguistics it's not a bad course. It helped me realize I don't want to pursue linguistics but I think it could be interesting to some people.",
                    "Interesting course material esp if you like studying foreign languages!",

The workload is incredibly light (one homework assignment a week) and all of the exam material is covered in class (also exams aren't bad, mostly multiple choice and short answer). Go to class and pay attention and you'll do well, but if you miss a lecture the notes are published. Material is dry but Dr. Achard makes it interesting (and it is actually pretty cool stuff too).",
                    "A well-organized and executed introductory linguistic course. A little bit memorization is required for the concepts, but otherwise the workload is pretty light. It's a great distribution course and an introduction to linguistics.",
                    "This is a great course, although it is harder than I expected it to be. You do have to put in effort to make a good grade, but if you're pass-failing it's very little work. An interesting D2.",
                    "Course was pretty easy, material wasn't really my thing but could be interesting for other people. Lectures can be useful but also not required, because all the info is on the powerpoints.",
                    "LING 200 is an incredibly interesting course if you are willing to learn. Achard made it to where class participation was essential, and his assignments as great ways to study for exams. However, the textbook was pretty dry, and while some participated in the class, that excitement did not go all the way to the back of the classroom. In addition to that, the material was often rushed to the point where it was difficult to take notes. I understand that there was a lot of material to get through, but if we took more time to discuss and fully understand the slides, I feel like there would have been a better outcome.",
                    "Super chill class for distribution. All assignments and exams are on canvas which is nice. Slides and some articles are all you need for the class and prof shares both. As long as you do a bit of work, class is a decently easy A",
                    "This course allowed me to better understand a field of knowledge I was not previously familiar with. It was very interesting and offered something for most majors",
                    "This has been a really interesting course. All of the topics are really fun to learn about, and since most of the material is probably pretty new to most students, it is really engaging even if it is not so advanced.",
                    "This was an interesting course because it teaches you to view language from a very different perspective. I'm a very STEM-oriented person, so this course helped me step out of my STEM bubble and look at language differently.",
                    "A good class to take if you are looking for D2 credit. The material is interesting and the workload is pretty light.",
                    "Not a great class to take. Class is boring to me, and I did find the subject to be interesting. I felt like I wasted too much time on this course learning coursework for no reason. I took this class for a class distribution, and I am disappointed that I even took this class. Would not recommend to anyone.",
                    "LING 200, being an intro class, covers an extreme broad range of topics. Unfortunately, it seems like because the material need to be known is so broad, none of the material seems interesting to me and it seems like a whirlwind of stuff to memorize. Memorize definitions of specific linguistics terms, memorize the phonetic alphabet, memorize the stages of how babies learn to talk... it just seems like so much memorization. There are some more interactive parts of the class like constructing sentences given a couple sentences in English and another language, but the majority of the class seems like memorization. Also, if you are taking this class in Herring 100, the room smells like the inside of an airplane or really bad perfume. I would only recommend this class if you like or already know you are interested in studying linguistics, and I would take something else if you need distribution 2 credit."

I personally did not find the first part of the course (phonetics, phonology, morphology) to be that interesting but the second part was very interesting to me. I enjoyed talking about syntax, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, and psycholinguistics. The homeworks are very helpful to practice the concepts learned in class and the frequent quizzes are good to make sure you don't fall behind in the work and since they are curved, they do not affect your grade too much. In the end, it is a very manageable class that is interesting as well",

In other words, if you think you might be into ling as a potential major, I'd definitely recommend it, but if you're just looking for a cool D2, this might not be it. Lectures were standard powerpoint slides each day, and we had about 8 homeworks throughout the semester (which we could check with others in the class).

One homework every other week, a midterm, and a final exam.

Essentially, you have to get a 70% or better on the quiz to earn the 2 points the module is worth. (These modules are all-around worth around 22% of your grade). You also have textbook readings which are very helpful for learning the material, alongside different handouts depending on the chapter. As a result, I would not push off doing the modules until Friday at 2pm, for instance. You have unlimited attempts at the modules, and you can also use them to study for the exams as well. There are 2 midterms (each noncumulative) and 1 final (cumulative); the first is worth 20% of your grade, the 2nd 25%, and the final exam 33%. This is not a blow-off class! You'll want to memorize and study things on the professor's powerpoint early, if you can. The TAs also provide midterm reviews, which is super super helpful for studying the exam! Definitely follow the reviews.",
                    "You get a lot out of the class and it isn't too demanding as long as you keep up with the lectures.",
                    "This is a really good course. It's been taught for so long that it's really polished and well put together. You start from the beginning with conversation and discourse, move through phonetics, morphology, syntax, etc. and end with sociolinguistics and other fun topics. I'd recommend this to someone in any major.",
                    "Took with Achard. Great survey of the various subfields of linguistics. I was able to identify which ones interested me most and which I might be interested in taking a deeper class on. The modules helped solidify the content without being too time consuming. I actually spent only about 4-5 days working on this class in the weeks after we got sent home by COVID-19, binge-watching lectures, doing modules, studying, and taking exams. This is not necessarily the best method for learning, but I was interested enough and the course content is well done enough that I think the material will stick. Probably not the easiest class if you have no language background/interest but you'll be ok.",
                    "This course gives a really broad overview of linguistics and covers a wide variety of topics. Modules due every week helped summarize what you would see in lectures. Lectures were pretty fast paced and really packed with information. Exams were pretty extensive and would have outside of exam data sheets that you should really do before the exam so you have enough time.",
                    "the class is well organized and makes sense as a progression through linguistics, the material is clearly presented and there are lots of resources to help you through it.",
                    "This is a good D2 class that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in languages. We covered a lot of topics, and some of them were very new and pretty hard. I put a lot of time to understand those topics, but it was totally worth it. I really liked the last chapter (language endangerment and revitalization) and the documentary We Still Live Here. The workload is average - completing modules and taking three exams (2 mid-term, 1 final).",
                    "I think Linguistics itself is a fascinating concept but the class as a whole is pretty dull. It's just too large a class for the subject, I think. There's clearly a lot of arbitration and winging-it in the field of linguistics and that level of nuance doesn't lend itself well to such a large classroom setting where students might reasonably expect more concrete and simple solutions. It's a super intriguing field but difficult to stick with due to the class's structure.",
                    "I did not enjoy the organization of this course. I think the content taught for the second midterm should have been the first concepts taught in the course. I felt like I was not given a chance to fully develop the skills I needed to succeed because of the course organization.",
                    "I LOVED this course. There are two midterms and weekly Canvas modules that get you to engage with the material while not being too difficult. The material is organized in the same order as the textbook so it's definitely worth reading.",
                    "meh",
                    "I really liked taking this course with Achard. His lectures were super engaging and that made it easier to understand the material. This class isn't too much work since there are only 2 exams and a final. I'd say if you have any experience with a foreign language, it'll help you understand some of the examples and concepts even better.",
                    "interesting intro course that covers a very wide variety of topics",
                    "idk I mean it's weekly module homework assignments and linguistics is cool, but not really my jam I guess. Still very doable as long as you properly study for the exams, which are mostly multiple choice and on Canvas",
                    "Really cool intro course that covers all the bases of introductory linguistics really well. Everything from the history of language to phonology to what language means for our human identity. I got a lot more into it than I thought it would... Im kind of a nerd for morphological analysis now. The material is just super cool and its not too much work, especially if your interested.",
                    "Ling 200 is a great class for D2. You will learn about a comprehensive picture of linguistics. The coursework is average with weekly quizzes (with unlimited attempts) and three big exams.",
                    "This class was harder than expected it to be. I enjoyed certain units and did not enjoy others. My favorite want the 1st and 3rd unit looking at the way language works within the wrold and where it came from. Personally, if it the units I did not enjoy as much if wasn't for the instructor I would have possibly dropped.",
                    "If you are interest in language at all I highly recommend this class. I was pushed to learn a lot about things I never would have considered learning on my own.",
                    "Ling 200 is a great course, you will learn a lot about language and cognition. Workload is not bad, there are readings and modules every week but they are not difficult or time-consuming and you will learn a lot from them! As a STEM major, this is a great distribution course and you will learn a lot without being overwhelmed by work.",
                    "I did not enjoy this course at all. Stay away from this course if you are taking it as a distribution requirement. The course is organized as extremely long powerpoint slides (each lecture had 60+ slides) and the instructor goes over them in very long lectures. It is an incredibly boring class with very dry material. The course is also very difficult, as you have to be really good at linguistic analysis, such as taking random words in different languages and finding patterns in them. The course requires many hours of work if you want to get an A, and it requires both memorization and practice problems (which are very difficult). This is coming from someone who got A's in all intro STEM courses so far.Unless you are passionate about linguistics, then this class is not worth the effort and boredom.",
                    "Dropped this class on the last day - never went to lecture the entire semester but my projected grade was probably an A- or B+. Really chill class - you can get an A if you put in a tiny bit of effort. Even though I dropped, it was still a really interesting class and made me more aware of different nuances in language and culture."

                    "I absolutely loved this course! The course covers the big ideas across the sub fields of linguistics, so each class was a completely new and exciting topic. I found everything we learned to be so incredibly interesting as I began to realize that I personally follow all these rules in the English language without ever realizing. Analyzing other languages to see how they do things differently was also super fascinating. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend taking this class to anyone who has even a passing interest.",
